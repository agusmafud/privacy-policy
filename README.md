# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** October 16, 2025

## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how this application (“the App”) handles user data when interacting with Meta platforms (such as Facebook, Instagram, or Messenger).  
We value your privacy and are committed to collecting and storing as little information as possible.

By using the App, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

---

## 2. Data We Collect

The App is designed to minimize data collection.  
Depending on its purpose, the App may temporarily access certain information provided by Meta, such as:

- **User IDs or Page IDs** – only to identify the Meta account that initiated a request.  
- **Messages or Events** – only if necessary for the App’s core functionality (e.g., automated responses, message delivery, or event processing).  
- **Access Tokens** – used solely to authenticate requests to Meta’s APIs.

No personal information beyond what is required for operation is collected.

---

## 3. How We Use the Data

Collected data is used **only** to provide the intended functionality of the App, for example:

- Sending or receiving messages through Meta’s APIs.  
- Handling webhooks and automations.  
- Responding to user actions.

Data is **never** sold, shared, or used for advertising, analytics, or profiling.

---

## 4. Data Storage and Retention

- The App does **not** store personal data permanently.  
- Temporary data (such as access tokens or webhook payloads) may be stored **in memory or logs** only for the duration necessary to process the request.  
- Logs are periodically deleted or anonymized.

If you uninstall or stop using the App, no data will be retained.

---

## 5. Data Sharing

We do **not** share user data with any third parties except when required by law or to comply with Meta’s platform policies.

---

## 6. Security

We take reasonable measures to protect any data handled by the App.  
All communication with Meta’s APIs occurs over **secure HTTPS connections**.

---

## 7. Your Rights

Since the App does not permanently store personal data, there is generally no data to access, modify, or delete.  
However, if you have concerns about how your information is handled, please contact us.
